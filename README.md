# Refactor-Tractor

This website is a clone of the site cooking.nytimes.com, it assists in a user's meal managment. The user can save a recipe to cook in the future, "checkout" all the ingredients necissary, favorite a recipe to store in their favorites tab, and view the recipe they want to cook, and manage their personal, virtual pantry. The app keeps track of favorites, ready to cook, and current pantry ingredients and quantity of the user and will show ingredients needed of any recipe the user may be interested in.

## Screen-shot


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

### Installing

This project is simple to build! We relied on webpack to process SASS into CSS and mochai chai to perform testing on this project.

## Running the tests

We run tests on Classes from the tests root folder. Using NPM, you can run tests from:
```
npm test
```
